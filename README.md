## Categories (Database Schema)

This section outlines the structure of categories within the database, which serves as the top-level organization for grouping items. Each category represents a distinct product group (e.g., smartphones, laptops), contains information that helps describe the category and contains links to images that are shown as a preview of the category.

### Fields:
- _id: Unique identifier for the category, automatically generated by the database.
- name: The name of the category (e.g., "Smartphones").
- description: A brief description of the category, providing context for the top of the page.
- images: An object containing image links that are used as preview for the category.

### Usage:

Categories are used to group items in the database. Each item references a category via a "category_id" field, allowing users to filter and browse items by category. This structure enables scalability as new categories can be easily added or modified.

## Items (Database Schema)

The items section defines the structure of products available within the catalog. Each item belongs to a specific category and contains detailed information, including images, specifications, and price.

### Fields:

- _id: Unique identifier for the item, automatically generated by the database.
- name: The name of the product (e.g., "Smartphone").
- description: A brief description of the item (e.g., "Latest model smartphone with advanced features").
- price: The price of the item in USD (e.g., 799.99).
- popularity: The index to show how popular this item is being sold (I will add support for leaving reviews later and it will become rating)
- category_id: Reference to the category the item belongs to, creating a relationship between items and categories.
- images: An object containing image links for the product. Includes a preview image for listing pages and a gallery array for detailed views.
- specs: An object containing the technical specifications of the product (e.g., brand, memory, battery).

### Usage:

Items represent the actual products displayed in the catalog. Each item is linked to a category, and the data model allows flexibility for adding multiple images and product-specific details. The specs field can be adapted to store any relevant specifications for different categories (e.g., processor for laptops, screen size for TVs).
